# Lake Ice Phenology Module

## Overview

Water is one of the earth's most precious resources, and is involved in almost many biogeochemical processes. Human activities often lead to problems with water quality. Concentrations of dissolved substances in freshwater varies over time and space, and depends on surrounding anthropogenic factors. Water quality significantly impacts not only ecosystem health (plants, animals, microorganisms, and other species) but also humans who depend on freshwater resources for recreation, tourism, and our very basic needs of waste management and drinking water. This module aims to help students understand the variability of concentrations of dissolved substances in stream water and identify some reasons for this variability. You will explore and evaluate water quality concerns with real-time data from regulatory entities, and learn about water quality ecosystem and human health implications.

## Questions

Does water quality exceed human health standards?

## Ojectives

-   Understand the variability of concentrations of dissolved substances in stream water and identify some reasons for this variability.
-   Find regulatory guidelines for nitrate concentrations in surface water, find real-time nitrate concentration data, and recognize when observed
    concentrations exceed guidelines
-   Practice importing data sets that aren't in a standard header format
-   Apply iteration for scaling-up analyses
-   Pasting strings and numbers together
-   Communicating with an API

## Requires



## Instructions

  - Open the notebook `assignment/water-quality.Rmd` in RStudio
  - Work through the exercises described in the notebook.
  - `knit` + commit output files to GitHub

## Context

This module has been developed as the second module in a junior-level Environmental Data Science course at Virginia Tech.  The course is require for majors in the Environmental Data Science degree.  The course has a pre-requisite course that introduces students to tidyverse concepts.  It assumes that students have set of Git and GitHub and understand how to commit and push through Rstudio.

## Timeframe

2-weeks (4 75-minute class periods are allocated to this module)

## Background Reading

The background reading is embbed in the assignment Rmarkdown as links to the relevant sections of [R for Data Science book (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.
